## Overview

### The Challenge

In this challenge, we are tasked with building a QR code component that matches the design provided. My component should:

- **Display a QR code:** The QR code image should be centered within a card.
- **Include a title and description:** The card should also include a heading and a brief paragraph of text below the QR code.
- **Follow the design closely:** Ensure my solution matches the design specifications in terms of layout, typography, colors, and spacing.

### Design

- **Files provided:** We will be provided with design files in JPEG or PNG format. We have to use these as a reference to replicate the design as closely as possible.
- **Responsive design:** The design should be fully responsive and look good on a variety of screen sizes.

### Requirements from the Frontend Mentor Challenge section

- **Technologies:** Use HTML and CSS to build your solution. You can use any additional libraries or frameworks if desired, but ensure the final product is as close to the design as possible.
- **Best practices:** Write clean, maintainable code following best practices for HTML and CSS.
- **Accessibility:** Consider accessibility in your design, ensuring that the component is usable by people with disabilities.
